abstract: >-
  EletromagArrays is a collection of Octave and Python
  scripts capable of modeling arbitrary antenna arrays and
  computing their resultant electromagnetic fields from the
  individual electric field of each antenna composing the
  array. It is suitable for systems excited with constant
  frequencies (Harmonic Regime) working on the far-field
  (Fraunhofer field) of the array and when each antenna is
  positioned in the far fields of all neighbors antennas, so
  that inducted currents on other antennas can be ignored.
  Each antenna is modeled as a point-like source of
  electromagnetic fields. The resultant fields are
  calculated from the array factor resulting from the
  translation and rotation of each antenna. The position,
  orientation and current magnitude and phase can be
  parametrized individually.
